# CONTAGION
This is a videogame made for Karaokulta's Remote Jam in home.

# About the story

COVID-19 HAS ARRIVED TO MEXICO !

And the "Great Mexican Family" didn't care about it. The pandemic contagion is here and seems that nothing can stop the curve. Not even the 4T with Susana Distancia, that has been slain in the Phase 3 of the contagion.

A medicine student, who works at a delivery service platform, with medical knowledge, is now witness of everything and has to deal with everything.

But it seems that there's a darker plot behind all of this, that has a huge relationship with 4T.

# Special acknowledgments

Also, as always, I want to thank all gamedev fellas. Karaokulta for organizing everything even when we were quarantined. Thanks to Starzy, Draic, Chemasmas, Kiramishima, Alastor, Aikas the Bard, the Iterandos', Mrs Blackcat, the FitFat fellas and all of the buddies that approach to me for at least saying hello or "Come on, get on your feet and start this game !!!"

Finally I want to thank all of jammers. This is from a gamer to all gamers.

Feel free to send me a DM via Github or an email to <marco.ramirez@dev1.mx> with your proposals. In the next times, I'll need some hands in the following areas:

- Game Design

## Development collaboration
You must have some skills with .NET and C#. Right now the use of Microsoft Visual Studio is required.

## Next steps
- Screen Manager (right now the transition between main and play screens is very rudimentary and there's no pause).
